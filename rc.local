sudo systemctl status rc-local

sudo systemctl enable rc-local

output:
The unit files have no [Install] section. They are not meant to be enabled
 using systemctl.
 Possible reasons for having this kind of units are:
 1) A unit may be statically enabled by being symlinked from another unit's
 .wants/ or .requires/ directory.
 2) A unit's purpose may be to act as a helper for some other unit which has
 a requirement dependency on it.
 3) A unit may be started when needed via activation (socket, path, timer,
 D-Bus, udev, scripted systemctl call, ...).


The solution

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/rc-local.service

Then add the following content to it.

[Unit]
 Description=/etc/rc.local Compatibility
 ConditionPathExists=/etc/rc.local

[Service]
 Type=forking
 ExecStart=/etc/rc.local start
 TimeoutSec=0
 StandardOutput=tty
 RemainAfterExit=yes
 SysVStartPriority=99

[Install]
 WantedBy=multi-user.target

sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local

printf '%s\n' '#!/bin/bash' 'exit 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/rc.local

sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local

sudo systemctl enable rc-local

output:

Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/rc-local.service to /etc/systemd/system/rc-local.service.

sudo systemctl start rc-local.service
sudo systemctl status rc-local.service
